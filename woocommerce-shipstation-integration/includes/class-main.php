	/**
	 * Keep the emails a shipment notification triggers out of the request.
	 *
	 * Recording a shipment writes a note and transitions the order, and
	 * WooCommerce sends the customer-note and completed-order emails inline off
	 * the back of that. Rendering an email is an unbounded amount of core and
	 * third-party work -- template hooks, the bundled CSS inliner, the mail
	 * transport -- and a fatal anywhere in it took the response down (SHIPSTN-165).
	 *
	 * The Order_Util helpers contain the failures that can be caught; this covers
	 * the ones that cannot. Memory exhaustion in the CSS inliner is an E_ERROR,
	 * so the only defence is to not render the email in this request at all.
	 * WooCommerce's own deferral hands the mail to Action Scheduler, which sends
	 * it moments later with per-email failure isolation, so nothing is lost.
	 *
	 * That last sentence is only true from WooCommerce 10.8, where
	 * `DeferredEmailQueue` was introduced. Before it, the same filter built a
	 * `WC_Background_Emailer`, and that object's constructors are the only thing
	 * that register the queue's two drain handlers -- the
	 * `wp_ajax_nopriv_wp_{blog_id}_wc_emailer` loopback worker and the
	 * `wp_{blog_id}_wc_emailer_cron` healthcheck. Because the filter is turned on
	 * for shipment notifications alone, the object exists only inside those
	 * requests, and the loopback the queue posts to itself
	 * (`admin-ajax.php?action=wp_{blog_id}_wc_emailer`) is not one of them. Nothing
	 * would ever drain the queue: the mail would never be sent and a
	 * `wp_{blog_id}_wc_emailer_batch_*` options row would leak per notification.
	 * Silently dropping the customer's shipment email is worse than the 500 this
	 * is fixing, so below 10.8 the deferral is skipped and delivery stays as it is
	 * today -- the Order_Util containment still covers the note-hook and
	 * email-render clusters there, leaving only the uncatchable OOM cluster,
	 * which is the current behaviour on those versions anyway. The probe is the
	 * mechanism itself rather than a version number, so it also fails closed onto
	 * that same behaviour if WooCommerce ever moves the class.
	 *
	 * Two priorities matter here:
	 *  - `init:9` -- late enough for themes and plugins to have registered, and
	 *    for a merchant's own `init` callback at priorities 1-8 to reach the
	 *    opt-out filter, while WooCommerce has not yet read its own filter at
	 *    `init:10`.
	 *  - `99` on the deferral itself, so an ordinary site-wide opt-out at the
	 *    default priority does not quietly reinstate the inline render. That is
	 *    precedence, not a guarantee: a callback at 100 or higher still wins,
	 *    which is why the plugin ships its own opt-out filter.
	 *
	 * @internal Not a public API: subject to change without a deprecation window.
