== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find documentation and a setup guide? =
You’ve come to the right place. [Our documentation](https://woocommerce.com/document/shipstation-for-woocommerce/) for ShipStation for WooCommerce includes detailed setup instructions, troubleshooting tips, and more.

= Where can I get support? =
To start, [review our troubleshooting tips](https://woocommerce.com/document/shipstation-for-woocommerce/#troubleshooting) for answers to common questions. Then, if you need further assistance, get in touch via the [official support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-shipstation-integration/).

= Do I need a ShipStation account? =
Yes; [sign up for a free 30-day trial](https://www.shipstation.com/?ref=partner-woocommerce&utm_campaign=partner-referrals&utm_source=woocommerce&utm_medium=partner).

= Does this extension provide real-time shipping quotes at checkout? =
No. Merchants will need a _real-time shipping quote extension_ (such as USPS, FedEx, UPS, etc.) or an alternate method (e.g. [flat rate charges](https://woocommerce.com/document/flat-rate-shipping/).

= Does ShipStation send data when not in use (e.g. for free shipping)? =
Yes; conditional exporting is not currently available.

= Why are multiple line items in a WooCommerce order combined when they reach ShipStation? =
This commonly occurs when products and variations do not have a unique [stock-keeping unit (SKU)](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/product-editor-settings/#what-is-sku) assigned to them. Allocate a unique SKU to each product — and each variation of that product — to ensure order line items show up correctly in ShipStation.

= My question is not listed; where can I find more answers? =
[Review our general FAQ](https://woocommerce.com/document/shipstation-for-woocommerce/#frequently-asked-questions) or [contact support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-shipstation-integration/).
